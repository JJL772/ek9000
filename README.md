# EPICS Support For Beckhoff EK9000

This is a device support module for the EK9000, which couples EtherCAT terminals (specifically the ELXXXX terminals from Beckhoff) to a modbus network.
Because it uses modbus, it's runnable on any IOC without needing a kernel module or other support software.

## Dependencies
This module depends on Mark River's modbus device support module/driver. You can grab that from here and make sure to grab it's dependencies too.

## Building
See the wiki page for instructions on building and a small example.

## Contributing
